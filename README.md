## What is NCP

NCP is a versioned, transport-agnostic wire contract that lets a running NEST network — point neurons (spiking, binary) and rate-based models — serve external robot, UAV, and analysis clients — for **perception, action, both, or neither** — over QoS-differentiated planes with a safety-gated action plane and scientific provenance on every frame. The reference implementation is a Rust SDK with Python, C/C++, and TypeScript peers that all speak the identical wire.

**Honesty boundary (binding):** returned `V_m`/spikes are raw simulation outputs of a specified model, never a validated reproduction. Every frame carries `is_simulation_output=true` and `calibrated_posterior=false`. A neuro-controller is a **control artifact**, never a paper-reproduction claim.

## Topology

One commander (e.g. an Engram/NEST brain, or any neuromorphic controller) coordinates one or more bodies over four QoS planes, each carrying the reliability, priority, and conflation its job needs.

| Plane | Key | QoS | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Control** | `{realm}/rpc/{request_kind}` (server: `{realm}/rpc/*`) | reliable, request/reply (queryable) | session lifecycle |
| **Perception** | `{realm}/session/{id}/sensor[/{name}]` | best-effort DROP (lossy-OK) | plant → brain |
| **Action** | `{realm}/session/{id}/command[/{name}]` | express, RealTime, safety-gated (`mode`, `ttl_ms`) | brain → plant |
| **Observation** | `{realm}/session/{id}/observation` | commander publishes; observers subscribe read-only | free diagnostic tap |

Because the data planes are pub/sub, **observers attach for free**: an analysis client subscribes read-only with zero changes to the control path — the structural reason to choose a data-centric bus over point-to-point RPC for a fleet plus watchers.

## Highlights

- **Transport-agnostic core.** `ncp-core` is `serde`-only — no transport, no async. The shipped runtime encoding is **JSON** (`serde_json`) on every plane; Zenoh is the recommended transport. `proto/ncp.proto` is the *schema* contract (IDL + conformance), not a second runtime wire — see [Encoding](#encoding-json-runtime-protobuf-schema).
- **Four QoS planes.** Control RPC, conflating perception, express RealTime action, and a read-only observation tap — each pays only the cost its job needs.
- **Safety-gated action plane.** A `mode` enum (`init`/`active`/`hold`/`estop`) is an explicit wire authority, backed by a latched ESTOP, `ttl_ms` HOLD fail-safe, a fail-closed command watchdog, and geofence checks.
- **Per-frame provenance.** `is_simulation_output` and `calibrated_posterior` are mandatory, fail-closed fields — a machine-checkable epistemic discriminator on the hot path.
- **Neuron-family coverage.** A generic named-recordable + named-parameter wire (`recordables[]`, `recordable`, `params{}`, plus the `binary_state` observable and `rate_inject` stimulus) serves NEST's point, conductance (`g_ex`/`g_in`/`w`), binary, and rate-based families — not just spiking.
- **Bounded bulk codec.** `ncp-core::bulk` provides a parse-free packed column block with a 64 MiB/resource budget and a cross-language golden vector. It is local/offline until the complete `BulkObservation` envelope is implemented in every SDK; Zenoh rejects bare NCPB blocks.
- **Conformance-tested wire (proto-native).** `proto/ncp.proto` is the normative contract; parity guards + a golden-vector corpus keep everything in lock-step — `conformance.rs` (Rust serde ↔ JSON Schema), `check_proto_schema_parity.py` (proto ↔ JSON Schema), JSON **and** binary golden vectors (`conformance/vectors/`), and a `buf breaking` WIRE/WIRE_JSON gate — so no representation can silently diverge.
- **Authenticatable action plane.** A default-deny, per-plane Zenoh ACL template (`deploy/zenoh-access-control.json5`) + mutual-TLS enablement steps let only an authenticated commander publish commands; observers stay read-only. The open-realm default is unauthenticated until this is enabled (see `SECURITY.md`).
- **Polyglot peers.** `proto/ncp.proto` is normative; `ncp-core` is the reference implementation. Python via PyO3, a C ABI for C/C++, and TypeScript types via ts-rs — every peer is wire-identical off the same contract, so the safety/codec logic is written once, not reimplemented per language.

## Encoding: JSON runtime, protobuf schema

NCP separates the **schema contract** from the **runtime encoding** — they are not the same thing, and conflating them is a common misreading.

- **Schema contract (source of truth).** [`proto/ncp.proto`](proto/ncp.proto) is the normative, language-neutral IDL. It defines every message and field, anchors the SemVer wire policy, and is enforced by `buf breaking` plus the golden-vector conformance corpus. Generated artifacts under [`gen/`](gen/) (including the prost Rust types in `gen/rust`) exist for schema parity and tooling — they are **not** compiled into the workspace and **not** on any runtime path (no crate's `Cargo.toml` depends on `prost`).
- **Runtime encoding (what ships on the wire).** Every plane carries **JSON** via `serde_json` — human-debuggable, schema-checked, and byte-identical across the Rust/Python/C/TS peers. `BulkBlock` is currently a bounded local/offline codec rather than a standalone frame.

**Why JSON, not protobuf-on-the-wire?** The control loop is dominated by NEST / in-sim compute, not by serialization. A full control tick costs on the order of **~1 µs** — e.g. `CommandFrame` encode ~248 ns / decode ~446 ns at 215 B, `SensorFrame` ~223 ns / ~474 ns at 195 B, `SafetyGovernor.govern` ~140 ns, `ReflexController.step` ~134 ns (measured release-mode by [`ncp-core/examples/overhead.rs`](ncp-core/examples/overhead.rs)); transport adds ~0.1 ms on a Zenoh loopback or tens of µs over SHM. That is ~0.003–0.1 % of a 20–1000 Hz control budget, so JSON's debuggability and zero codegen-coupling win and a binary on-wire encoding buys nothing measurable. If a kHz, bandwidth-constrained consumer ever needs it, protobuf can become an **opt-in, negotiated** encoding without changing the schema contract. The largest remaining *safe* win is internal, not on the wire: `ncp-zenoh`'s `ZenohBus::put` copies each payload (`payload.to_vec()`), which defeats the enabled SHM zero-copy — see [`PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md) and [`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for the full cost model and backlog.


## Crates

| Crate | Role |
|---|---|
| **`ncp-core`** | Pure protocol: wire types (serde), version guard, key scheme, reference rate codec, action-plane safety governor, in-process bus + control loop. `serde`-only, no transport. |
| **`ncp-zenoh`** | The recommended decoupled transport: Zenoh *queryable* (control RPC) + *pub/sub* (perception/action/observation), each with its plane's QoS. |
| **`ncp-python`** | Python binding (PyO3): the Rust core as an importable `ncp` module, so Python peers are wire-identical without reimplementing. |
| **`ncp-cpp`** | C / C++ binding: a stable C ABI (`extern "C"` + `include/ncp.h`) over the same core. |
| **`ncp-ts`** (`@sepahead/ncp`) | TypeScript package: wire types generated from `ncp-core` (ts-rs) + a transport-agnostic client and a WebSocket transport — wire-identical to the Rust/Python peers. |
| **`ncp-gateway`** | The commander's Rust edge (reference deployment, e.g. an Engram/NEST host): runs the Zenoh bus and bridges control-plane RPC to a simulation `SessionService` over a localhost socket (NEST stays Python). |

## Polyglot quick-start

One normative wire ([`proto/ncp.proto`](proto/ncp.proto) / [`NEURO_CYBERNETIC_PROTOCOL.md`](NEURO_CYBERNETIC_PROTOCOL.md)); pick the peer for your language. Each per-peer README below is the deep doc — this matrix is the index.

| Peer | Install / depend | Open session · step · observe | Transport(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`ncp-core`** (Rust) | `ncp-core = { git = "https://github.com/sepahead/NCP", tag = "v0.7.0" }` | Build `OpenSession` / `CommandFrame`, `serde_json::to_string` → wire — see [`ncp-core/README.md`](ncp-core/README.md) | none (serde-only; in-process bus + control loop) |
| **`ncp-zenoh`** (Rust transport) | `ncp-zenoh = { git = "https://github.com/sepahead/NCP", tag = "v0.7.0" }` | `let bus = ZenohBus::open().await?; let client = ZenohNcpClient::new(bus); client.open(&msg).await?` — see [`ncp-zenoh/README.md`](ncp-zenoh/README.md) | Zenoh (queryable RPC + per-plane pub/sub) |
| **`ncp-python`** (Python / PyO3) | `maturin develop -m ncp-python/Cargo.toml --features extension-module` | `import ncp; ncp.Keys("ncp").command("uav3"); ncp.decode_command(...)` — see [`ncp-python/README.md`](ncp-python/README.md) | transport-agnostic (JSON wire via `ncp-core`) |
| **`ncp-cpp`** (C / C++ ABI) | `cargo build -p ncp-cpp` → link `libncp_cpp`, `#include "ncp.h"` | `char *v = ncp_version(); /* ... */ ncp_string_free(v);` — see [`ncp-cpp/README.md`](ncp-cpp/README.md) | transport-agnostic (JSON in/out over the C ABI) |
| **`ncp-ts`** (`@sepahead/ncp`, TypeScript) | `npm install @sepahead/ncp` | `const ncp = new NeuroSimClient(transport.send); await ncp.open(...); await ncp.step(...); await ncp.close(...)` — see [`ncp-ts/README.md`](ncp-ts/README.md) | WebSocket (`WebSocketNeuroSim`) or any `Send` bus |

## Quickstart

NCP is **not yet published to crates.io** (pre-1.0). Depend on it as a pinned git dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
ncp-core  = { git = "https://github.com/sepahead/NCP", tag = "v0.7.0" }
ncp-zenoh = { git = "https://github.com/sepahead/NCP", tag = "v0.7.0" }  # latest immutable release
```

A minimal, wire-correct snippet using `ncp-core` — build a safety-gated `CommandFrame`, then refuse an incompatible peer version:

```rust
use ncp_core::{check_version, ChannelValue, CommandFrame, Mode, NCP_VERSION};

// A controller's actuation, gated by mode + a time-to-live fail-safe.
let cmd = CommandFrame {
    seq: 42,                       // echoes the SensorFrame.seq it was computed from
    mode: Mode::Active,            // init / active / hold / estop
    ttl_ms: 200.0,                 // HOLD fires if the actuator outlives this
    channels: [(
        "velocity_setpoint".to_string(),
        ChannelValue::vec3(0.5, 0.0, -0.2, Some("m/s")),
    )].into_iter().collect(),
    ..Default::default()
};
let wire = serde_json::to_string(&cmd)?;   // wire-identical to the Python / TS peers

// Fail closed on an incompatible peer (pre-1.0: minor is breaking).
assert!(check_version(NCP_VERSION, true)?);     // exact match -> Ok(true)
assert!(check_version("0.9", true).is_err());   // 0.x minor diff -> rejected
```

- **Spec:** [`proto/ncp.proto`](proto/ncp.proto) is the normative wire contract. The JSON Schemas in [`schemas/`](schemas/) are generated from the Rust reference types and then checked bidirectionally against the proto by `scripts/check_proto_schema_parity.py`; the generated TS types and every behavior runner are pinned to the same contract and corpus. See [`schemas/README.md`](schemas/README.md) and the human-readable [`NEURO_CYBERNETIC_PROTOCOL.md`](NEURO_CYBERNETIC_PROTOCOL.md).
- **Conformance + benchmarks:**

```bash
scripts/check.sh              # full conformance / smoke matrix (all crates + bindings)
cargo test -p ncp-core        # pure, fast: wire-compat + codec + safety + control loop
cargo run -p ncp-core --release --example overhead   # per-frame ser/de + safety/reflex cost model (see PERFORMANCE.md)
python scripts/bench_realtime.py   # NEST real-time-factor sweep (see NEST_REALTIME.md)
python scripts/bench_overlap.py    # transport/compute overlap (GIL) measurement
```

## Examples

Runnable, self-contained demos of the wire in motion. The pure-`ncp-core` ones need no transport and no NEST; the Zenoh one runs a single in-process session (no router required); the NEST one needs an Engram bridge backend.

```bash
# Per-frame cost model: JSON (de)serialization, the safety governor, the reflex
# controller, and the binary BulkBlock vs JSON for the same observation payload.
cargo run -p ncp-core  --release --example overhead

# Full UAV motion + safety: closed-loop flight to a target, then every safety gate
# (speed clamp, geofence -> latched ESTOP, stale-sensor HOLD, ttl watchdog,
# predictive-horizon replay) exercised deterministically.
cargo run -p ncp-core  --example uav_control_safety

# Drone-in-the-loop over the Zenoh ACTION plane: a controller flies a simulated quad
# via CommandFrames on the exact key a body subscribes to (engram/ncp/session/<id>/command);
# mode=hold/estop and the ttl_ms watchdog visibly stop the drone. Writes a JSONL
# trajectory an external consumer (e.g. crebain) can replay.
cargo run -p ncp-zenoh --example uav_drone_loop

# Five distinct NEST spiking models (LIF, exp-LIF, Izhikevich, Hodgkin-Huxley,
# adaptive-EIF) driven through the NCP RPC contract against an Engram NEST bridge.
python e2e/nest_five_networks.py
```

The drone-loop and NEST demos show the two halves of the hub model: a commander like **Engram** drives bodies (UAVs/robots) over the action plane and reads spiking models over RPC — the same wire a standalone body like **crebain** speaks when it chooses to federate instead of flying on its own.


## Ecosystem

NCP is the **wire contract only** — it bakes in no consumer. These are the reference
and example peers that pin it (latest released pin: `tag = v0.7.0`, wire 0.7); your own commander,
body, or analysis client speaks the same wire:

<picture>
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"  srcset="docs/diagrams/ecosystem-dark.svg">
  <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" srcset="docs/diagrams/ecosystem-light.svg">
  <img alt="NCP ecosystem: a single highlighted NCP wire-contract node at center (crates ncp-core, ncp-zenoh, ncp-gateway; peers ncp-python, ncp-cpp, @sepahead/ncp; wire 0.7 release, contract f05e328cad20959d). Three example consumers in a left column pin the latest immutable release tag v0.7.0: Engram (example commander), crebain (example body), prisoma (example observer client). A separate pid-rs node (PID estimators science library) links to prisoma by a distinct dashed grey edge labelled 'git submodule · NOT an NCP wire consumer' and does not connect to the contract." src="docs/diagrams/ecosystem-light.svg" width="820">
</picture>

The example observer client [`prisoma`](https://github.com/sepahead/prisoma) is public; the other peers shown are illustrative.

Concretely, the reference consumers exercise different roles off the *same* wire:

- **Engram** (a.k.a. Paper2Brain) — the **hub / command-center**: a NEST spiking-simulation backend that drives robots and UAVs interchangeably *through* NCP, acting as the commander on the Control + Action planes.
- **crebain** — a tactical-UAV application that is **dual-mode**: it runs **standalone** with its own onboard drone stack, **and/or** federates with a commander like Engram over NCP — both or either, with no NCP-specific assumptions baked into the protocol.
- **prisoma** — a read-only **observer / analysis** client that attaches to the observation plane for free.

That NCP itself is generic — no consumer-specific types, no assumption that a hub or a body is even present — is exactly what lets these very different applications interoperate (and lets each run without the others).

## FAQ

### What is NCP?
A versioned, typed, transport-agnostic **wire contract** that lets a running NEST
neural simulation (spiking, binary, and rate-based) perceive and act through robots,
UAVs, and analysis clients. It is a Rust SDK (`ncp-core`) with wire-identical Python,
C/C++, and TypeScript peers, carried over Zenoh (recommended), WebSocket, or any bus.

### How is NCP different from ROS 2 / DDS?
NCP is **complementary to**, not a replacement for, ROS 2 — a host app can share one
Zenoh session across ROS traffic and NCP. NCP adds what a generic robotics bus does
not: a neuroscience-aware record/stimulus model, mandatory per-frame scientific
provenance, and a safety-gated action plane with an explicit `mode`/`ttl_ms` wire
authority. See [`RATIONALE.md`](RATIONALE.md).

### How is NCP different from MUSIC?
MUSIC (Djurfeldt et al. 2010) and the ROS-MUSIC toolchain (Weidel et al. 2016)
pioneered real-time NEST↔robot loops; NCP is informed by, not a replacement for, that
lineage. NCP is a typed cross-language *wire contract* with versioning, a safety gate,
and provenance — where MUSIC is an MPI-based port-connection runtime. See
[`NEST_REALTIME.md`](NEST_REALTIME.md).

### Is NCP real-time? Can it read NEST live without stopping it?
Yes — NCP reads a running NEST kernel chunk-by-chunk without halting it, like MUSIC.
[`NEST_REALTIME.md`](NEST_REALTIME.md) reports a measured real-time-factor sweep; the
transport overhead is well under the simulator's per-chunk cost.

### Does NCP reproduce neuroscience papers?
**No.** Returned `V_m`/spikes are raw simulation outputs of a specified model, never a
validated reproduction. Every frame carries `is_simulation_output=true` and
`calibrated_posterior=false`, a machine-checkable epistemic boundary. A
neuro-controller is a control artifact, not a paper-reproduction claim.

### What transports and languages does it support?
Transports: Zenoh per-plane bus (recommended/shipped), a WebSocket/JSON fallback, and
an optional gRPC service for lifecycle RPC. Languages: Rust (`ncp-core`, reference),
Python (PyO3), C/C++ (C ABI), and TypeScript (`@sepahead/ncp`) — all wire-identical off
the one `proto/ncp.proto` contract.

### Which version do I pin?
Pin the latest immutable release tag, **`v0.7.0`**, for production. It speaks wire
`0.7` with contract hash `f05e328cad20959d`. Pre-1.0
the minor is breaking, so a `0.6` peer and a `0.7` peer cleanly refuse each other.

### Is the action plane secure?
Not by default. On an open realm the action plane is world-writable; the `mode`/`ttl_ms`
governor is defense-in-depth, not network security. Deploy on a trusted closed realm,
or enable the shipped per-plane Zenoh ACL + mutual TLS — see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

### Is the wire protobuf or JSON?
Both appear, but they play different roles. **Protobuf is the schema** — [`proto/ncp.proto`](proto/ncp.proto) is the normative IDL the SemVer policy and conformance corpus enforce — **not the shipped runtime encoding.** Every shipped plane, including observation, carries **JSON** (`serde_json`). `BulkBlock` is a bounded local/offline codec; Zenoh rejects a bare NCPB block until a complete `BulkObservation` envelope is implemented and negotiated across every SDK. The prost-generated Rust types in `gen/rust` are for parity/tooling and are not compiled into the SDK. A protobuf-on-the-wire encoding could be added later as an opt-in negotiated option. See [Encoding](#encoding-json-runtime-protobuf-schema).


## Status

NCP is **pre-1.0 and experimental.** Specifically:

- **The wire may change.** Minor versions are treated as breaking; the version guard fails closed rather than coercing. Pin `v0.7.0` for the latest release.
- **One reference implementation, four gated surfaces.** `proto/ncp.proto` is the normative contract and `ncp-core` (Rust) is the behavioral reference. Python and C/C++ call that core through FFI; TypeScript independently ports the plant-side decisions. All four replay one behavior corpus, while independent live-transport clients outside Rust remain deliberately deferred.
- **The default/open configuration is unauthenticated.** Anyone who can reach that bus can publish commands. A complete opt-in mTLS router/client profile and default-deny ACL ship under `deploy/`, but the local `mode`/`ttl_ms` governor remains defense-in-depth, **not** network security. Use the secure profile or a trusted isolated network; see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
- **A hardening backlog is open, audited, and partly closed.** [`KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md`](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) keeps each remaining risk and proposed fix visible. Wire 0.7 resolves the newly found cross-language acceptance/provenance/bulk issues without pretending the transport, unit/arity negotiation, or deployment-security work is finished.

## Acknowledgements / prior art

NCP builds in the spirit of established work and claims no novel control science:

- **MCP / ACP** — versioned, schema-first capability handshakes for agents inform NCP's control-plane versioning and capability negotiation.
- **MUSIC** (Djurfeldt et al. 2010) and the **ROS-MUSIC toolchain** (Weidel et al. 2016) — the continuous-(V_m/rate) vs event-(spikes) channel taxonomy and the first real-time NEST-to-robot closed loops; NCP is informed by, not a replacement for, this lineage.
- **HBP Neurorobotics Platform / NRP-core** — the closest data-model prior art for declaring what to record and inject.
- **Zenoh** — the data-centric transport whose queryables, conflation, express priority, and routed subscriptions NCP inherits (credited to the substrate, not invented here).

NCP's actual contribution is a **typed, provenance-first, safety-gated wire contract** that complements this work — not novel control science, and not the first SNN-in-the-loop robot loop.
